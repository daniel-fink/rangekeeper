# Rangekeeper

Rangekeeper is an open-source 
[library](https://github.com/daniel-fink/rangekeeper) assisting financial 
modelling in real estate scenario planning, decision-making, cashflow 
forecasting, and the like.

It decomposes elements of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Proforma modelling 
approach into recomposable code functions that can be wired together to form a 
full model.

Development of the library follows the rigorous methodology established by MIT 
Professors David Geltner and Richard de Neufville, in their book [Flexibility 
and Real Estate Valuation under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide for 
Developers](https://www.wiley.com/go/geltner-deneufville/flexibility-and-real-estate-valuation)
, and expands it into a more robust computational framework.

There are two sections to the walkthrough:
1. **Real Estate Flexibility and Valuation under Uncertainty**: a series of 
   notebooks providing a walkthrough of the library in parallel with chapters of
   the book. 
2. **Using Rangekeeper in Examples**: notebooks that showcase some of the 
   library's functionality in practice 

This walkthrough is intended for use by practitioners who are both familiar with 
the book's content, and well-versed in data-science-oriented programming.
