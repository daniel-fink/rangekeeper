If you *really* need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.\n",
