# Rangekeeper

Rangekeeper is an open-source [library](https://github.com/daniel-fink/rangekeeper) assisting financial modelling in real estate scenario planning, decision-making, cashflow forecasting, and the like.

It decomposes elements of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Proforma modelling approach into recomposable code functions that can be wired together to form a full model.

Development of the library follows the rigorous methodology established by MIT Professors David Geltner and Richard de Neufville, in their book [Flexibility and Real Estate Valuation
under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide for Developers](https://www.wiley.com/go/geltner-deneufville/flexibility-and-real-estate-valuation), and expands it into a more robust computational framework.

This series of notebooks provides a walkthrough of the library in parallel with chapters of the book. It is intended for use by practitioners who are both familiar with the book's content, and well-versed in data-science-oriented programming. 

If you wish to tinker with the notebooks themselves, please feel free to open them in Google Colab, by using the ![Interactive Notebook Launch Icon](resources/rocket.png) icon at the top of each notebook.
