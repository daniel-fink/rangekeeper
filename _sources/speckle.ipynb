    "# Loading a Design Scenario\n",
    "*Rangekeeper* provides API access to [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/). This\n",
    "enables loading and extending a 3D design scenario with *Rangekeeper* to produce\n",
    "its financial valuation, as well as execute any automated decision-making or\n",
    "optimisation processes, and sending the results back to Speckle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Model\n",
    "Before walking through the I/O methods, it is important to understand the\n",
    "requirements *Rangekeeper* places on how a design scenario must be structured,\n",
    "so that the `Flow`s and `Stream`s of a DCF Proforma can be appropriately\n",
    "attributed to the design scenario's objects (especially its representations of\n",
    "physical spaces, components, and equipment).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements and Relationships\n",
    "A holistic representation of a real estate development scenario is that it is a\n",
    "web of inter-related 'elements'; where each element is a 'thing' and can have\n",
    "multiple relationships with other elements. For example, a floor is a type\n",
    "of element (say, a 'Space') and it has relationships with floors above and\n",
    "below it, as well as relationships to its sub-elements (e.g. rooms), or even\n",
    "what services it (e.g. the mechanical systems controlling its air conditioning)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `Element`s\n",
    "An `Element` is a ‘thing’ that has substance, or is composed of sub-`Element`s\n",
    "that have substance, material, mass, volume, existence, are ‘real’, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Relationship`s\n",
    "`Relationship`s describe some sort of association, connection, or link between\n",
    "`Element`s. Each `Relationship` is described by its ‘type’; for instance, an\n",
    "`Element` can be related to another by virtue of it “being contained\n",
    "(spatially)” by the other, or it could be “installed before” another `Element`.\n",
    "There can be any number of `Relationship`s between any number of `Element`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Assembly`s\n",
    "In order to clearly encapsulate ‘groups’ of intuitively-related `Element`s,\n",
    "*Rangekeeper* has a concept of an `Assembly`, which is an object that defines\n",
    "a collection of `Relationship`s and their associated `Element`s.\n",
    "`Assembly`s are `Element`s themselves, too –- so they can also be related to\n",
    "other `Element`s.\n",
    "This means that *Rangekeeper* can traverse from `Assembly` to `Assembly` through\n",
    "overlapping `Element`s, in a similar fashion to common-sense conceptualisation\n",
    "of how a real estate development scenario is structured.\n",
