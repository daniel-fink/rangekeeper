    "requirements *Rangekeeper* places on how a design must be structured,\n",
    "so that the `Flow`s and `Stream`s of a DCF Proforma can be appropriately\n",
    "attributed to the design's objects (especially its representations of\n",
    "physical spaces, components, and equipment).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entities and Relationships\n",
    "A holistic representation of a real estate asset is that it is a\n",
    "web of inter-related 'entities'; where each entity is a 'thing' and can have\n",
    "multiple relationships with other entities. For example, a floor is a type\n",
    "of entity (say, a \"Space\") and it has relationships with floors above and\n",
    "below it, as well as relationships to its sub-entities (e.g. rooms), or even\n",
    "what services it (e.g. the mechanical systems controlling its air conditioning)\n",

    "An entire Real Estate asset is represented as a huge web (graph) of `Entity`s\n",
    "and `Relationship`s between those `Entity`s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Entity`s\n",
    "An `Entity` is a ‘thing’ that has substance, or is composed of sub-`Entity`s\n",
    "that have substance, material, mass, volume, existence, are ‘real’, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Relationship`s\n",
    "`Relationship`s describe some sort of (directed) association, connection, or\n",
    "link between `Entity`s. Each `Relationship` is described by its ‘type’; for\n",
    "instance, an `Entity` can be related to another by virtue of it “being\n",
    "contained (spatially)” by the other, or it could be “installed before” another\n",
    "`Entity`.\n",
    "There can be any number of `Relationship`s between any number of `Entity`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Assembly`s\n",
    "In order to clearly encapsulate ‘groups’ of intuitively-related `Entity`s,\n",
    "*Rangekeeper* has a concept of an `Assembly`, which is an object that defines\n",
    "a collection of `Relationship`s and their associated `Entity`s.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "#### Properties of `Entity`s\n",
    "All `Entity`s have the following properties:\n",
    "1. **entityId**: a unique & immutable identifier for the `Entity` over the whole of\n",
    "    its lifetime.\n",
    "2. **Name**: human-readable text identifying the `Entity`\n",
    "3. **Type**: an `entityType` (which is a node of a tree of `entityType`s)\n",
    "4. **Attributes**: a key-value store of specific properties of the `Entity`\n",
    "   (eg, its area, geometry, material, cash flows, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, `Assembly`s record a set of `Relationship`s about `Entity`s that\n",
    "are related to, or in, the `Assembly`.\n",
    "1. **Relationships**: a set of `Relationship`s\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of `Relationship`s\n",
    "Meanwhile, all `Relationship`s have the following properties:\n",
    "1. **Type**: a `RelationshipType`, which is an item from a list of defined\n",
    "   `RelationshipType`s\n",
    "2. **Source**: the `Entity` that is the source of the `Relationship`\n",
    "3. **Target**: the `Entity` that is the target of the `Relationship`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Event`s\n",
    "Every `Entity` can exist in both space and time. Most `Entity`s will have (or\n",
    "its sub-`Entity`s will have, in the case of an `Assembly`) geometry/s that\n",
    "define the extent of space that the entity exists in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent how an `Entity` exists in time, the `Entity` has `Event`s\n",
    "recorded against it. For example, an `Event` may record the installation of the\n",
    "`entity` during construction, or it may record production of revenue during\n",
    "operation of the real estate project as an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow`s and `Stream`s are subclasses of `Event`s.\n",

    "## Rationale and Implications\n",
    "*Rangekeeper* will use the `Relationship`s defined in the `Assembly`/s of a\n",
    "design to structure the \"drill-downs\" and \"roll-ups\" (ie, the\n",
    "compositions) of `Flow`s into `Stream`s that are appropriate for the kinds of\n",
    "summations and metrics that the DCF Proforma model requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an office building may produce revenue from multiple tenants. A\n",
    "tenant may occupy multiple floors, or a part (space) of a single floor.\n",
    "For *Rangekeeper*, each space would be an `entity`; with its `Events` property\n",
    "containing a set of `Flow`s and/or `Stream`s that represent revenues or costs\n",
    "associated with that space. Those may be aggregated into cash flows generated by\n",
    "the tenant of those spaces, and analysed as such, or they may be aggregated per\n",
    "floor, or per building, or per project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it simple to calculate things like the share of total revenue\n",
    "generated by each tenant; or the share of revenue generated by each floor.\n",
    "Likewise with costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-faceted nature of the [`Entity`-`Relationship` model](\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) enables\n",
    "multiple pathways for those aggregations to be specified, and thus enables an\n",
    "efficient and broad ability to query the model for the kinds of analyses\n",
    "pertinent to real estate valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technicalities\n",
    "To provide a *Rangekeeper* model with the `Entity`-`Relationship` organization,\n",
    "those need to either be defined in the design itself, or they need to\n",
    "be specified after receiving and loading the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining `Entity`s and `Relationship`s in the Design Scenario\n",
    "*Rangekeeper* uses the [Speckle](https://speckle.systems) service and data model\n",
    "for the exchange of designs, and scaffolds `entity`s off a [Speckle\n",
    "`Base`](https://speckle.guide/dev/base.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides two means to define `entity`s and `Relationship`s:\n",
    "1. A plugin to [McNeel's Rhinoceros3D Grasshopper]\n",
    "   (https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper/), that enables both automated and\n",
    "   manual assignment of `Relationship`s to geometries before their export to\n",
    "   Speckle; and\n",
    "2. Manual assignment of `Relationship`s to `Entity`s once they have been loaded\n",
    "   from a Speckle stream in *Rangekeeper*."
