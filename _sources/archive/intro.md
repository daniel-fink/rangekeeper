# Rangekeeper

Rangekeeper is an open-source python-based [code 
library](https://github.com/daniel-fink/rangekeeper) for financial
modelling in real estate asset & development planning, decision-making, cashflow
forecasting, and scenario analysis.

Rangekeeper enables real estate valuation at all stages and resolutions of 
description — from early-stage ‘back-of-the-envelope’ models to detailed 
commercial assessments, and can be completely synchronised with 3D design, 
engineering, and logistics modelling.

It decomposes elements of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Proforma modelling 
approach into recomposable code functions that can be wired together to form a 
full model.

Development of the library follows the rigorous methodology established by MIT 
Professors David Geltner and Richard de Neufville, in their book [Flexibility 
and Real Estate Valuation under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide for 
Developers](https://www.wiley.com/go/geltner-deneufville/flexibility-and-real-estate-valuation)
, and expands it into a more robust computational framework.

This walkthrough is intended to provide a brief introduction to the library, as 
well as examples of its use in practice. There are two sections to the 
walkthrough:
1. **Real Estate Flexibility and Valuation under Uncertainty**: a series of 
   notebooks providing a walkthrough of the library in parallel with chapters of
   the book. 
2. **Using Rangekeeper in Examples**: notebooks that showcase some of the 
   library's functionality in practice 

This walkthrough is intended for use by practitioners who are both familiar with 
the book's content, and well-versed in data-science-oriented programming. 

For those interested, notebooks can be run interactively via Google Colab, by
clicking the ![Open In Colab](./resources/rocket.png) icon at the top of each 
notebook.
```{note}
Note: installation of the library via `!pip install rangekeeper` is required 
for use in Google Colab.
