    "1. Non-substitutability and non-fungibility of real estate assets.\n",
    "2. Inefficiency of information processing in real estate markets.\n",
    "3. Autoregression in real estate pricing\n",

    "5. Mean reversion in real estate pricing\n",

    "Because of these, the real estate pricing dynamics that are input into simulations should include autoregression, cyclicality, and mean‐reversion, in addition to random-walk process.\n",

    "The methodology to produce a simulation of a real estate market is by using 'pricing factors'; a ratio that multiplies the original, single‐stream pro forma cash flow expectation to arrive at a future cash flow outcome for a given scenario. The use of pricing factors as a way to develop representative\n",
    "scenarios based on available data on the historical variations in market prices for real estate. In this methodology, the pricing factors substantially enhance the traditional random walk process, by recognizing the special features of the dynamics of real estate markets. The resulting output simulation distributions offer a much richer and fuller picture of the future than the traditional, single‐stream DCF.\n",
